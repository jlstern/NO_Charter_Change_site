				<h2>Why Vote "NO?"</h2>
				<ol type="num">
					<h3><li>Removing Ward Councilors <span class="under">Reduces Local Representation and Accounability</span></li></h3>
					<p>Currently we have Ward Councilors who are beholden to only the voters in their ward. With the proposed change, all Councilors would be elected citywide. The problem:  The Councilor residing in your ward could be non-responsive to you and your neighbors, yet still be re-elected handily by voters in the rest of the city. Right now a Ward Councilor has every incentive to represent the voters in her ward, otherwise they may not re-elect her! <span class="under">Newton citizens will greatly miss having a Ward Councilor in their corner if Ward Councilors are eliminated.</span></p>
					<h3><li>Removing Ward Councilors <span class="under">Concentrates Political Power</span></li></h3>
					<p>Under the proposed scheme, it is highly likely that the five Councilors with no residency requirement will end up coming from -- and representing! -- the wealthier and more powerful parts of Newton, <span class="under">further empowering the voices of those who do not need further empowerment.</span> What evidence do we have of this?  In Lowell, where all representatives are elected at-large, although 40% of the population are people of color, every School Committee member and every City Councilor is white. And after Worcester switched to an all at-large system, every member of its City Council came from the more affluent west side. </p>
					<h3><li>Removing Ward Councilors <span class="under">Makes It Harder for Independent Voices to Win</span></li></h3>
					<p>The Commission’s proposal will make it much harder for independent voices -- and those not part of powerful political networks -- to run and prevail. First, there is the expense:  It is significantly more costly to run a citywide campaign, compared to a ward campaign. Then there is the time:  When running only in a ward, it is possible to knock on every door. But it is virtually impossible to knock on every door citywide, particularly for candidates who also have jobs and children. Shouldn’t we want to make it easier for newcomers to run and win, rather than harder?</p>
					<h3><li>Reducing the Size of the Council <span class="under">Turns Councilors into Full-time Politicians</span></li></h3>
					<p>If the City Council size is reduced -- increasing each councilor’s workload to virtually full time, as is the norm in Cambridge and Boston -- then Newton will lose the rich experience that comes from its Councilors having a day job. Most of the 24 current Councilors either work or are retired from a career, and as a result bring their unique perspective and experience to each policy debate.</p>
					<h3><li>Removing Ward Councilors <span class="under">Runs Counter to American Representative Government</span></li></h3>
					<p>When Charter Commission members are asked why they want to eliminate Ward Councilors, they say, “It’s not fair for a Councilor elected by voters of only one ward to be able to make decisions that affect the whole city.” This is at odds with the rest of our American government structure.  Our State Representatives are elected from Newton, yet they vote on issues affecting Massachusetts. Members of Congress are elected only by one Congressional District, and Senators are elected by only one state, yet they all make decisions that affect the whole Country. That is our system!  It works very well -- even at the local level -- and we should keep it.</p>
